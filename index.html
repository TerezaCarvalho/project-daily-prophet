      <h2>FANTASTIC BEASTS 3</h2>
      <span>Headed to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</span>
      <p>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them brought Newt Scamander
         across the Atlantic to New York City, the first time the Harry Potter 
         franchise showed us magical life in America. The British-born magizoologist and his 
         friends then traveled back to Europe in The Crimes of Grindelwald, letting us explore the 
         wizarding world of Paris, France. Now we know which never-before-seen magical place the next 
         movie will visit. Wizards, witches, and jolly bakers named Jacob alike will be taking the battle 
         against Gellert Grindelwald to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, home to one of the oldest and most 
         prestigious schools of magic in the world, one that might be getting a visit from a famous 
         American professor.</p>
